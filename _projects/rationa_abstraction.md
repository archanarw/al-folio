Developed a framework for automatically simplifying physics simulations by constructing adaptive model abstractions that balance computational accuracy with resource constraints, inspired by human cognitive processes. Implemented proof-of-concept in MuJoCo demonstrating how abstractions can be optimized based on query requirements.
