Created a representation-agnostic benchmark for evaluating world-model learning in AI agents, featuring 43 interactive grid-world environments with 129 tasks across masked-frame prediction, planning, and change detection. Evaluated 517 humans and frontier reasoning models, revealing substantial gaps in AI's world-modeling capabilities {% cite warrier2025benchmarking %}.
