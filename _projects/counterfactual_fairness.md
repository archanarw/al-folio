Developed [CounterfactualFairness.jl](https://github.com/zenna/CounterfactualFairness.jl), a Julia package implementing counterfactual reasoning methods for algorithmic fairness. The package provides tools for assessing multiple fairness criteria including counterfactual fairness and path-specific effects in decision-making systems.

### Implementation Challenges

- Representing causal graphs efficiently
- Handling both discrete and continuous variables
- Implementing counterfactual inference algorithms

A blogpost detailing the implementation can be found [here](https://nextjournal.com/archanarw/counterfactualfairnessjl/).
