I'm interested in understanding intelligence---both how humans think and how thinking can be modeled computationally. Rather than copying cognition directly, I want to discover the fundamental principles that underlie intelligent behavior.


I'm a Computer Science Masters student at Technische Universität Kaiserslautern (RPTU) and a Research Trainee at Basis, New York, working on Project MARA (Modeling, Abstraction, and Reasoning Agents). Previously, I earned my Bachelor's in Mathematics and Computing from Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra.

You can find more about my work in my [publications](/al-folio/publications/) and [projects](/al-folio/projects/) pages.
